# CLAUDE.md - Systems Ecosystem Overview

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the multi-project systems ecosystem.

## Ecosystem Overview

This workspace contains a collection of interconnected research and development projects exploring cognitive frameworks, AI integration, and advanced computational systems. Each project maintains its own CLAUDE.md file with specific guidance.

**Ecosystem Philosophy:** Recursive cognitive integration across multiple domains and scales.

**Status:** Active development and research across multiple projects.

## Project Directory

### üß† Cognitive & AI Research
- **[ariaproj/](./ariaproj/)** - Recursive Cognitive Integration Framework (RCIF) with Cognitive Sparse Encoded Architecture
- **[anthropic_project/](./anthropic_project/)** - Multi-provider AI client and CLI for Claude/OpenAI integration
- **[ClaudeMetaResearch/](./ClaudeMetaResearch/)** - Meta-analysis and research frameworks for AI systems
- **[grok-mem/](./grok-mem/)** - Fractal communication framework and memory systems

### üåå Specialized Research
- **[cosmo-neuro-junction/](./cosmo-neuro-junction/)** - Epistemological junction between cosmology and cognitive neuroscience
- **[persona-julia-windows/](./persona-julia-windows/)** - Julia-based persona modeling and cognitive simulation
- **[campus-ambas/](./campus-ambas/)** - Campus ambassador program and educational technology

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools
- **[zed_improve_gemini/](./zed_improve_gemini/)** - Editor improvements and development tooling
- **[utilities/](./utilities/)** - Shared utility functions and common tools
- **[build-logic/](./build-logic/)** - Build system configuration and shared build logic

## Global Build Commands

### Multi-Language Environment Setup
```bash
# Python environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
python install_dependencies.py

# Java/Gradle projects
./gradlew build

# Mojo projects (where applicable)
magic install
```

### Cross-Project Operations
```bash
# Find all CLAUDE.md files
find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -type f

# Run tests across all projects
find . -name "gradlew" -exec {} test \;
find . -name "run_tests.py" -exec python {} \;

# Linting across ecosystem
find . -name "*.py" -exec flake8 {} \;
find . -name "*.java" -path "*/src/*" -exec checkstyle {} \;
```

## Ecosystem Guidelines

### Universal Principles
- **Recursive Integration:** Each project should connect to and enhance others
- **Cognitive Frameworks:** Maintain awareness of cognitive and therapeutic models
- **Documentation Standards:** Follow the established CLAUDE.md template
- **Cross-Pollination:** Share insights and patterns across projects

### Development Workflow
1. **Project Selection:** Navigate to specific project directory
2. **Local Setup:** Follow project-specific CLAUDE.md instructions
3. **Integration Awareness:** Consider cross-project implications
4. **Documentation Updates:** Maintain both local and ecosystem documentation

### Quality Standards
- **Type Safety:** Strong typing across all languages (Python, Java, Mojo, TypeScript)
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage with clear patterns
- **Documentation:** Clear, accessible documentation with examples
- **Integration:** Thoughtful connections between projects and concepts

## Navigation Guide

For specific project guidance, refer to individual CLAUDE.md files:
- Each project directory contains detailed build, test, and development instructions
- Project-specific architectural patterns and code style guidelines
- Integration points and dependencies with other ecosystem projects

## Ecosystem Configuration

### Shared Resources
- **claudesystems.ini** - Global configuration and settings
- **goose-35-claude.ini** - AI assistant configuration
- **gradle.properties** - Shared Gradle configuration
- **pixi.toml** - Package management configuration

### Documentation Standards
- **Template Version:** 2.0 (based on ariaproj/CLAUDE.md)
- **Required Sections:** Project Overview, Repository Structure, Build Commands, Guidelines
- **Optional Sections:** Architecture Patterns, Integration Points, Performance Considerations

## Important Notes

- This ecosystem emphasizes recursive cognitive integration and fractal communication patterns
- Each project should maintain its autonomy while contributing to the larger cognitive framework
- Refer to individual project CLAUDE.md files for specific technical guidance
- Cross-project collaboration is encouraged and facilitated through shared patterns

**Ecosystem Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** Documentation Template Rollout Phase
