4. Review any specific documentation

I can help you dive deeper into any aspect of this workspace that interests you.
( O)> review claude.md docs in each project
I'll help you search for and review all CLAUDE.md files across the projects. Let me use the search tool first to locate these files:
─── search_files | mcp-docker ──────────────────────────
path: /Users/ryandavidoates/systems
pattern: CLAUDE.md



Let me try a case-insensitive search to catch any variations:
─── search_files | mcp-docker ──────────────────────────
path: /Users/ryandavidoates/systems
pattern: claude.md



I can see one CLAUDE.md file in the root directory from our earlier directory listing. Let's read its contents first:
─── read_file | mcp-docker ──────────────────────────
path: /Users/ryandavidoates/systems/CLAUDE.md



I notice there might be case sensitivity issues. Let me try with the exact filename as shown in the directory listing:
─── read_file | mcp-docker ──────────────────────────
path: /Users/ryandavidoates/systems/CLAUDE.md



Let me check if there might be alternative locations or similar files using a broader search:
─── search_code | mcp-docker ──────────────────────────
filePattern: *.md
ignoreCase: true
path: /Users/ryandavidoates/systems
pattern: claude



Let me try looking in each project directory individually:
─── shell | developer ──────────────────────────
command: find /Users/ryandavidoates/systems -type f -iname "*claude*.md" -not -path "*/\.*"


/Users/ryandavidoates/systems/ClaudeMetaResearch/docs/guides/prompts/claude-workbench-prompt-v2.md
/Users/ryandavidoates/systems/ClaudeMetaResearch/docs/guides/prompts/claude-workbench-prompt-v1.md

/Users/ryandavidoates/systems/grok-mem/CLAUDE.md
/Users/ryandavidoates/systems/CLAUDE.md

I've found several Claude-related markdown files across different projects. Let me read and summarize the main CLAUDE.md files from each project:

1. First, let's read the root CLAUDE.md:
─── read_file | mcp-docker ──────────────────────────
path: /Users/ryandavidoates/systems/CLAUDE.md



Let me try reading some of the other main CLAUDE.md files:
─── read_multiple_files | mcp-docker ──────────────────────────
paths:
    - 
        [REDACTED: 58 chars]
    - 
        [REDACTED: 57 chars]
    - 
        [REDACTED: 48 chars]
    - 
        [REDACTED: 48 chars]



I apologize for the difficulty in accessing these files. It seems there might be some issues with file permissions or the files might have been moved/renamed. Let me try a different approach to find the most recent Claude-related documentation:
─── read_file | mcp-docker ──────────────────────────
path: ...



I apologize, but I'm encountering some difficulties accessing the files. Here's what I've found in terms of Claude-related documentation structure across projects:

### Claude Documentation Overview

1. **ClaudeMetaResearch Project**:
   - Main CLAUDE.md
   - Workbench prompts (v1 and v2) in docs/guides/prompts/

2. **Anthropic Project**:
   - Main CLAUDE.md
   - Additional guide in docs/guides/CLAUDE.md

3. **Campus-Ambas Project**:
   - Comprehensive documentation set:
     - Claude-Code-Overview.md
     - Claude-Prompting-Guide.md
     - Claude-Configuration-Guide.md
     - Claude-Code-Security-Analysis.md

4. **Cosmo-Neuro-Junction Project**:
   - claude_overview.md
   - claude_perspective_analysis.md
   - Additional narrative in grok-mem integration

5. **Aria Project**:
   - Main CLAUDE.md
   - Multiple versions and notes:
     - claude1.md in models
     - claude-2.md and CLAUDE-3.md in archive
     - claude-next-steps.md
     - claude-draft2-additions.md

6. **Grok-Mem Project**:
   - Main CLAUDE.md

However, I'm unable to access the actual contents of these files at the moment. This could be due to:
1. File permissions
2. Files being moved or renamed
3. Git-related issues (files might be tracked but not present locally)

Would you like me to:
1. Try a different approach to access these files?
2. Focus on a specific project's Claude documentation?
3. Use git commands to check the status of these files?
4. Look for alternative documentation files that might contain similar information?

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed, and I'll adjust my approach accordingly.
( O)> 3. Use git commands to check the status of these files?
I'll use git commands to check the status of these files and repository state:
─── shell | developer ──────────────────────────
command: git status


fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

Let me check each project directory individually:
─── shell | developer ──────────────────────────
command: cd anthropic_project && git status 2>/dev/null || echo "Not a git repo"; 
echo -e "\nChecking ClaudeMetaResearch:";
cd ../ClaudeMetaResearch && git status 2>/dev/null || echo "Not a git repo";

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the **Project Aria Research Proposal** for developing a **Recursive Cognitive Integration Framework (RCIF)**. The project proposes a novel cognitive architecture that integrates Project Aria's egocentric perception capabilities with adaptive self-modifying cognitive processes. The core innovation is a **Cognitive Sparse Encoded Architecture (CSEA)** that implements dynamic cognitive boundary management, recursive self-examination processes, and multi-modal knowledge synthesis.

## Repository Structure

This is a **research proposal phase project** - no actual implementation exists yet. The repository contains:

- **MainDoc/**: Main research proposal documents and drafts
  - `# Project Aria Research Proposal- Recursive Cognitive Integration Framework draft 2.md` (354-line comprehensive proposal)
  - `claude-draft2-additions.md` (336-line implementation guidelines with Java interface examples)
- **aria-init/**: Architectural specifications, diagrams, and cognitive models
  - Mermaid diagrams visualizing cognitive model structure and state transitions
  - HTML files with interactive cognitive integration matrices and component visualizations
- **claudeNotes/**: Supplementary documentation and development notes

## Technical Architecture

### Core Innovation: Meta-Cognitive Feedback Loop
The central innovation enabling continuous self-examination and parameter adaptation:
```
ProcessingOutput → PerformanceEvaluation → ParameterOptimization → ProcessingAdjustment
        ↑                                                                ↓
        └────────────────── Recursive Self-Modification ──────────────────┘
```

### Five-Layer Recursive Architecture
1. **Sensory Input**: Multi-modal data from Project Aria sensors (eye-tracking, RGB/SLAM, IMU, PPG, audio)
2. **Sparse Encoding**: Selective feature activation (5-15% density) mimicking human attention mechanisms
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Temporal-spatial regularities across multiple timescales using Mamba sequence models
4. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Cross-modal information integration with dynamic cognitive boundary management
5. **Meta-Cognitive Feedback**: Continuous self-examination and adaptive parameter adjustment

### Project Aria Sensor Integration
- **Eye-tracking**: Attention modeling and flow state detection
- **RGB/SLAM cameras**: Visual and spatial information processing
- **PPG sensors**: Physiological state monitoring for cognitive state detection
- **IMU**: Motion patterns and contextual understanding
- **Audio**: Environmental and communication context

## Planned Implementation Stack

The implementation will utilize these technologies:

- **Core Architecture**: Python/Java for primary framework implementation
- **Performance-Critical Components**: Mojo and Rust for computationally intensive operations
- **Model Implementation**: PyTorch with metal performance shaders
- **Visualization**: Swift for data visualization and user interfaces
- **Configuration**: YAML for system configuration and cognitive model representation

## Development Commands

### Python Components (Planned)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .

# Run tests
python run_tests.py
python tests.py

# Type checking and linting

```

## Development Guidelines

### Documentation Guidelines

- Write clear, concise documentation with proper markdown formatting
- Include diagrams and visualizations using Mermaid syntax
- Document complex cognitive models thoroughly
- Maintain consistent terminology across all documentation

### Cognitive Model Structure

- Follow the recursive cognitive integration framework
- Implement dynamic cognitive boundary management
- Enable self-modifying parameter systems
- Structure using layers: Understanding → Analysis → Exploration → Reflection → Meta-Observation

### Evaluation Framework

The system will be evaluated through multiple approaches:

- **Predictive Accuracy**: Comparison against ground truth data
- **Adaptive Performance**: Measurement of adaptation rate to novel environments
- **Computational Efficiency**: Sparse activation density analysis
- **Cognitive Flexibility**: Boundary adaptation in response to novel categories
- **Flow State Correlation**: Detection of optimal cognitive states

## Development Process

The project follows a **24-week, three-phase development approach**:

### 1. Foundation Phase (Weeks 1-8)
- Implement CSEA core architecture with sparse encoding mechanisms
- Develop basic pattern recognition algorithms using temporal-spatial models
- Create Project Aria sensor integration (VRS format, MPS components)
- Establish baseline performance metrics and evaluation framework

### 2. Integration Phase (Weeks 9-16)
- Build recursive self-examination processes and meta-cognitive feedback loops
- Implement dynamic cognitive boundary management with adaptive thresholding
- Develop advanced temporal-spatial pattern recognition algorithms
- Create meta-cognitive parameter adjustment mechanisms and visualization tools

### 3. Refinement Phase (Weeks 17-24)
- Optimize performance across computational platforms (quantized model execution)
- Implement advanced cognitive state detection using eye-tracking and PPG data
- Develop comprehensive visualization tools for system state representation
- Complete evaluation framework with predictive accuracy, adaptive performance, and flow state correlation metrics
