# Cognitive Framework Principles

This document captures the core principles of each cognitive framework used across the ecosystem, summarizing goals, key components, and pattern flows.

## Fractal Communication Framework (FCF)
- Goal: Modular recursive thought processing with meta-cognitive monitoring.
- Key Components:
  - Reflection Engine: Analyzes input using meta-cognitive patterns.
  - Anchor Module: Selects therapeutic anchors based on context.
  - Synthesis Module: Combines reflection and anchored response.
  - Memory Module: Maintains conversation history and user profiles.
- Pattern Flow: Initial State (z₀) → Recursive Elaboration (z²) → Complementary Input (c) → Synthesized State (zₙ)

## Recursive Cognitive Integration Framework (RCIF)
- Goal: Integrate multi-modal perception with adaptive self-examination.
- Key Components:
  - Sensory Input Layer: Processes data from sensors (e.g., eye-tracking, IMU).
  - Sparse Encoding Layer: Selective feature activation for efficiency.
  - Pattern Recognition Layer: Temporal-spatial regularity detection.
  - Knowledge Synthesis Layer: Cross-modal information integration.
  - Meta-Cognitive Feedback Loop: Continuous parameter adaptation.
- Pattern Flow: Sensory Input → Sparse Encoding → Pattern Recognition → Knowledge Synthesis → Meta-Cognitive Feedback
