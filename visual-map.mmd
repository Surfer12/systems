## Cross-Project Analysis

### 1. **anthropic_project/**
- **Role:** Core technical hub for integrating Anthropic Claude and OpenAI models.
- **Key Features:** 
  - Unified API client (MultiProviderClient) for Anthropic and OpenAI.
  - Emphasis on code quality, security, and multi-language support (Python, Java, Mojo, Node.js).
- **Educational Link:** Provides the technical backbone for educational tools, enabling experimentation with different LLMs in a consistent interface.

### 2. **ClaudeMetaResearch/**
- **Role:** Research and framework development for prompt engineering and cognitive modeling.
- **Key Features:** 
  - Documentation and analysis of prompt patterns, mental models, and meta-cognitive strategies.
  - API structure and validation best practices (TypeScript, Rust, Hono, zod).
- **Educational Link:** Develops and documents best practices for using Claude in educational and research contexts; informs the design of prompts and workflows in other projects.

### 3. **grok-mem/**
- **Role:** Memory and knowledge representation, possibly for cognitive augmentation.
- **Key Features:** 
  - Code style and testing guidelines for Java and Python.
  - Focus on memory modules and cognitive frameworks.
- **Educational Link:** Supports research into how memory and knowledge can be structured for AI-assisted learning.

### 4. **ariaproj/claudeNotes/**
- **Role:** Research project focused on cognitive models and documentation.
- **Key Features:** 
  - Recursive cognitive integration, meta-cognitive feedback, and reproducibility.
  - Emphasis on documentation and cross-referencing.
- **Educational Link:** Explores advanced cognitive models and methodologies for educational AI.

### 5. **campus-ambas/**
- **Role:** Deployment and educational outreach for Claude Code.
- **Key Features:** 
  - Guides and documentation for using Claude Code in educational settings.
  - Focus on project memory, permissions, and workflow automation.
- **Educational Link:** Directly supports students and educators in using Claude for coding, learning, and research.

## Visual Map Plan

Below is a textual representation of the visual map. I can generate a Mermaid diagram (which you can render in Markdown or tools like VS Code, Obsidian, or GitHub):

- **B**: Research, prompt engineering, best practices
- **C**: Memory, cognitive frameworks, knowledge representation
- **D**: Cognitive model research, advanced methodologies
- **E**: Educational deployment, documentation, outreach

## How to Use This Map

- **A (anthropic_project)** is the technical core, enabling all other projects to use Claude and other LLMs.
- **B (ClaudeMetaResearch)** and **C (grok-mem)** provide research, frameworks, and cognitive models that inform both the technical and educational aspects.
- **D (ariaproj/claudeNotes)** is a specialized research node, feeding advanced cognitive models into the research and educational pipeline.
- **E (campus-ambas)** is the outward-facing educational deployment, using the technical and research outputs to support real users.
